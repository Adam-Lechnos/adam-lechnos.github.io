Iâ€™m a DevOps engineer embracing cloud computing and automation technologies using best-of-breed open-source software, with a background in Information Security consulting for startups, finance, and healthcare organizations. I also have a finance background in tax-efficient long-term investing, stock options, real estate, and business tax strategies.

As a hobby, I enjoy playing with home automation technologies and modeling tactical and strategic economic circumstances, both macroeconomics and microeconomics.
