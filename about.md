Iâ€™m a DevOps engineer embracing cloud computing and automation technologies using best-of-breed open-source software, with a background in Information Security consulting for startups, finance, and healthcare organizations. I also have a finance backgorund in tax efficient long term investming, stock options, real estate and business tax strategies.
